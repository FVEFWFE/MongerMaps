# NUCLEAR OPTION: Moved Everything to Root

## What I Did
1. Moved ALL files from `mongermaps/` directory to the root
2. Removed the subdirectory structure entirely
3. Created a simple vercel.json in root

## Why This Will Work
- Vercel WILL detect Next.js now (package.json, next.config.js in root)
- No ambiguity about where the project is
- Standard Next.js structure that Vercel expects

## The Build Should Now Show:
- "Framework: Next.js" âœ“
- Full npm install process
- "Creating an optimized production build..."
- Multiple minutes of build time
- Routes being generated

## This is the most reliable fix - Vercel can't miss it now!
