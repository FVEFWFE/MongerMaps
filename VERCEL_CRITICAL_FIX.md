# CRITICAL: Vercel Not Detecting Next.js Framework

## The Problem
Your deployment logs show:
- "No framework detected"
- Build completed in 104ms (way too fast for Next.js)
- No actual Next.js build is happening

This is why ALL routes return 404 - Vercel isn't building or deploying your Next.js app at all!

## The Fix
1. Created `vercel.json` in the ROOT directory (not in mongermaps/)
2. Set `rootDirectory: "mongermaps"` to tell Vercel where the Next.js app is
3. Explicitly set `framework: "nextjs"`

## What Was Happening
- Vercel was looking for a Next.js app in the root directory
- Found nothing, so deployed nothing
- Your `mongermaps/vercel.json` was being ignored

## Deployment Commands
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Add root vercel.json to fix framework detection"
git push
```

## After This Deploy
You should see in the build logs:
- "Framework: Next.js"
- Actual npm install running
- Next.js build process
- Routes being generated

If this doesn't work, we may need to:
1. Move all files from mongermaps/ to root
2. Or configure Vercel project settings to set root directory
