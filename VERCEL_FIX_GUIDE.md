# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue: 404 Error on Vercel

Your environment variables are correct! The issue is likely:

1. **Build Failed** - Missing dependencies
2. **Database URL** - Using internal Railway URL instead of public

## Fix Steps:

### 1. Update Database URL in Vercel

Your current URL uses `postgres.railway.internal` which only works inside Railway.

**To get the public URL:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click your PostgreSQL database
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Look for `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` or the URL that contains `containers-us-west-XXX.railway.app`
5. Copy that URL
6. Update in Vercel:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` with the public URL

The public URL should look like:
```
postgresql://postgres:EGfEnfkzZaQhjIaMpDJXVYhArkbQQSPj@containers-us-west-123.railway.app:5432/railway
```

### 2. Redeploy with Fixed Dependencies

I've already fixed the missing dependencies in the project. You need to:

1. **Commit and push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix missing dependencies for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-redeploy** when you push to GitHub

### 3. If Build Still Fails

Check the Vercel build logs:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Functions/Deployments
2. Click latest deployment
3. View build logs

Common issues:
- ESLint errors (can disable in next.config.js if needed)
- TypeScript errors (can set `ignoreBuildErrors: true` temporarily)

### 4. Quick Workaround

If you need to get it running quickly, update `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
};
```

## Verifying the Fix

After redeploying:
1. Visit https://monger-maps.vercel.app
2. You should see the landing page
3. Check https://monger-maps.vercel.app/api/auth/signin for auth

## Your Current Setup Status

‚úÖ Environment variables are correct
‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_URL is properly set (no trailing slash - good!)
‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_SECRET is properly generated
‚ö†Ô∏è DATABASE_URL needs to be the public URL
üîß Dependencies have been fixed locally (need to push)

## Next Steps

1. Update DATABASE_URL in Vercel to public URL
2. Push the code changes to trigger redeploy
3. Monitor build logs
4. Test the deployment

The app should work after these fixes!
