# URGENT: Vercel Not Deploying ANY Files

## Problem Identified
- Even static HTML files return 404
- This means Vercel is NOT deploying this branch AT ALL
- The issue is NOT with Next.js configuration

## Root Causes (Most Likely)

### 1. Branch Not Connected to Vercel
- Vercel might only be watching the `main` branch
- Feature branches might not trigger deployments

### 2. GitHub Integration Issue
- Vercel's GitHub app might have permission issues
- Repository might not be properly connected

### 3. Deployment Protection
- Branch might be excluded from deployments
- Preview deployments might be disabled

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Merge to Main Branch
```bash
# Create PR and merge these fixes to main
# Then Vercel should deploy automatically
```

### Solution 2: Check Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
2. Check:
   - **Production Branch**: Should be `main`
   - **Preview Branches**: Should include all branches or your specific branch
   - **Ignored Build Step**: Should be empty or have proper settings

### Solution 3: Manual Deployment
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import from Git
4. Select your repository
5. Choose the branch: `cursor/troubleshoot-persistent-vercel-404-error-8542`
6. Deploy

### Solution 4: Use Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy manually
vercel --prod
```

## What's Happening

The deployment URL pattern:
`monger-maps-git-cursor-troubleshoot-pe-7fcb9d-fvefwfes-projects.vercel.app`

Suggests this is a preview deployment that either:
1. Never built successfully
2. Is not connected to your GitHub commits
3. Has been deleted or expired

## Recommended Action

1. **FIRST**: Check Vercel Dashboard
   - Are there ANY deployments showing for your commits?
   - Is the project connected to the right GitHub repo?

2. **THEN**: Either:
   - Merge to main branch (if main deploys work)
   - Create new Vercel project
   - Use Vercel CLI for manual deployment

The configuration changes we made are fine - the problem is Vercel isn't even trying to build your branch!
