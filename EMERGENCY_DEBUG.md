# Emergency Debugging Steps for Vercel 404

## What We've Done

1. Created fallback `pages/` directory with:
   - `/pages/index.js` - Simple homepage
   - `/pages/api/hello.js` - Simple API route

2. Simplified configuration:
   - Removed all complex imports
   - Disabled TypeScript/ESLint checks
   - Added Node.js version requirement (>=18.17.0)

3. Both routing systems are now available:
   - App Router: `/src/app/*`
   - Pages Router: `/pages/*`

## Test These URLs After Deployment

1. **Pages Directory Routes:**
   - `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/` - Pages homepage
   - `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/hello` - Pages API

2. **App Directory Routes:**
   - `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/minimal` - App router test
   - `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/test` - App router API

## Check Vercel Build Output

In Vercel Dashboard, look for these in the build logs:

### Success Indicators:
- "Creating an optimized production build..."
- "Compiled successfully"
- "Collecting page data..."
- "Generating static pages"

### Failure Indicators:
- "Module not found"
- "Cannot resolve"
- "Build error occurred"
- No mention of generating pages

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Build Shows Success but No Routes
**Symptom:** Build completes but no pages are generated
**Solution:** Check if output shows "Generating static pages (0/0)"

### 2. Module Resolution Errors
**Symptom:** "Module not found: Can't resolve '~/...'"
**Solution:** The path alias might be broken

### 3. Runtime Errors
**Symptom:** Build succeeds but runtime fails
**Solution:** Check Function Logs in Vercel dashboard

## Nuclear Options

### Option 1: Create Fresh Next.js App
```bash
# In a new directory
npx create-next-app@latest test-app --no-typescript --no-eslint --no-tailwind
cd test-app
vercel
```

### Option 2: Use Vercel's Example
```bash
vercel init nextjs
```

### Option 3: Minimal package.json
Replace entire package.json with:
```json
{
  "name": "mongermaps",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "14.2.25",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Vercel Support Ticket Information

If nothing works, contact Vercel support with:
1. Deployment URL showing 404
2. Project name: MongerMaps
3. Error: "NOT_FOUND" on all routes including `/pages/index.js`
4. Build appears successful but no routes are accessible

The fact that even basic routes return 404 suggests:
- Build output is not being generated
- Vercel is not detecting the Next.js app correctly
- There's a fundamental configuration conflict
